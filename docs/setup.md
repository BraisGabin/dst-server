Setting up the server is pretty easy if you got Docker already running.
Find a quick step-by-step guide how to setup the dedicated server below.

## Overview

1. Install [Docker Engine][engine-setup].
2. Install [Docker Compose][compose-setup]. *(optional but recommended)*
3. Configure a [`docker-compose.yml`][compose-file] configuration. *(optional but recommended)*
4. [Start a container][engine-run] i.e. [launch the service][compose-up].

The [DST:A Suite][suite] provides common Docker Compose configurations.
